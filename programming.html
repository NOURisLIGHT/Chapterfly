                        <div class="description">
                            <p>This is one of the best classic books for beginners and will teach you all tricks and patterns of writing good and clean code. Every code which runs is not a clean code. Most beginner programmer done this mistake, they just try to solve the problem and hence forgets these factors to write clean and perfect professional code. A Clean Code should be properly readable, and well structured so that it could be reused and debugged easily.</p>
