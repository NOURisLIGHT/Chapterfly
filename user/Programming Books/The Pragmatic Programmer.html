            <p>This is book is by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, about programming and software engineering. The unique feature of this book is it teaches us in a pragmatic way with a collection of tips to improve the programming and development process rather than the theoretical way. This book will help you to become a pragmatic programmer, an early adopter, to have fast adaptation, inquisitiveness, critical thinking, realism, and a jack-of-all-trades. The book presents development methodologies and caveats, analogies, and short stories too, for example, the broken windows theory, the story of the stone soup, or the boiling frog.</p>
            <h5>Ideas Presented</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Present development methodologies and processes using many analogies and short stories. e.g, the stone soup, or the story of the boiling frog</li>
                <li>Many concepts were named which get popular in this book, such as code katas</li>
                <li>More use of methods for making and preserving codes highly adjustable</li>
                <li>Useful recommendations for estimates of time and expense</li>
                <li>Introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered.</li>
