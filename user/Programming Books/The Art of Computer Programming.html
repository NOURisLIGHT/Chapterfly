                <strong>Description:</strong>
                <section>(TAOCP) is a comprehensive monograph written by the computer scientist Donald Knuth:<br>
                    It presents programming algorithms and their analysis. The first three volumes were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. Work on Volume 4 began in 1973 but was suspended for typesetting work. Since then, additional volumes and fascicles have been released.
                </section>
                <p>This is another classic book written by the famous computer scientist Professor Donald Knuth. This book is very popular and highly praised by many of the top programmers in the world for its combined mathematical exactness with outstanding humor throughout the chapters. Through his well-known book series art of computer programming, for his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms, Knuth was awarded the Turing Award in 1974. The book begins with basic programming concepts and techniques, explores various programming algorithms and describes their analysis efficiently, and then focuses particularly on the representation of information inside a computer(information structure). </p>
